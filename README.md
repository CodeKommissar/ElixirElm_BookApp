# Books2018 App

![Screenshot of the site](http://lrodriguez.me/images/books_2018.png)

Experimental App made with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org/) and [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). 

The goal of this Web App was to get better at Functional Programming by learning the basics of two functional languages and creating a simple CRUD application. Altough the app is unfinished I learned a ton and found two languages that I would like to keep using in the future.
